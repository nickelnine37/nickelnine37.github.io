This is a blog for me to publish some of the random bits and bobs I've worked on for fun. There's not much of a structure, no particular theme and no fixed schedule. It's really just an assortment of odds and sods - generally something I've found interesting recently relating to programming. I hope it's useful/enjoyable to someone.

If you want to get in touch, drop me an email at <edward.antonian1@gmail.com>.

My CV can be found [here](CV.pdf).
